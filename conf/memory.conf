# Memdump_tmp is a temporary slice cut out of RAM, used to process volatility memory dumps more quickly
# It should be no less in size than (the number of processing workers in /etc/init.d/cuckoop) x (size of each memdump)
# So if you're processing 10 at a time, and your RAM dumps are 4 GB, your tmp slice needs to be at least 41GB
# If that were the case, you'd drop this in your /etc/fstab and put /dev/shm in memdump_tmp below
# none    /dev/shm        tmpfs   defaults,size=41G       0       0
# I normally enable this, have the normal 'delete memory file' routine clear the one from memory
# Then let utils/crontab/cuckoo/clean_mem.sh clean out the actual memory dumps based on time/size
