#[vpn0]
## Name of this VPN. The name is represented by the filepath to the
## configuration file, e.g., cuckoo would represent /etc/openvpn/cuckoo.conf
## Note that you can't assign the names "none" and "internet" as those would
## conflict with the routing section in cuckoo.conf.
#name = vpn0
#
## The description of this VPN which will be displayed in the web interface.
## Can be used to for example describe the country where this VPN ends up.
#description = Spain, Europe
#
## The tun device hardcoded for this VPN. Each VPN *must* be configured to use
## a hardcoded/persistent tun device by explicitly adding the line "dev tunX"
## to its configuration (e.g., /etc/openvpn/vpn1.conf) where X in tunX is a
## unique number between 0 and your lucky number of choice.
#interface = tun0
#
## Routing table name/id for this VPN. If table name is used it *must* be
## added to /etc/iproute2/rt_tables as "<id> <name>" line (e.g., "201 tun0"). 
## ID and name must be unique across the system (refer /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
## for existing names and IDs).
